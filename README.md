# cod4x_PezBot
Attempting to learn Game modding, game scripting, bots, and a lot more as I try to adapt an old COD4 mod to the new cod4x client.

# Purpose
I want to play against bots that actually work on my private cod4x server with friends. 

# Notes
PeZBOT will load up if you just try to set it up with cod4x, and you can even join a match and see the bots walking around, but they're not working correctly. [This](https://cod4x.me/index.php?/forums/topic/533-cod4x-and-pezbots/) thread on cod4x describes a near identical situation, that appears to have been resolved, but with no one uploading the scripts, or shairing the spoils of this troubleshooting process. 

Some back and forth conversation in the thread details possible causes and fixes. Will need to reference this for changes and testing.
